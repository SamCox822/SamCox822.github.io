Hi! My name is Samantha Cox, and I am a 2nd year PhD student at the University of Rochester, studying chemical engineering under the advisement of Dr. Andrew White in the [WhiteLab](http://thewhitelab.org/). I received my BS in Chemistry from Lee University in 2021. My graduate research is focused on developing and applying computational tools to solve chemistry and chemical engineering problems. Specifically, my recent work has been focused on molecular dynamics and deep learning. You can read more about my publications in the [publications](https://samcox822.github.io/publications/) tab, or you can check out my talks in the [talks](https://samcox822.github.io/talks/) (in progress).

Outside of my research, I enjoy embroidery, hiking, guitar and videography. Check out the [dog pics](https://samcox822.github.io/dogs/) tab for pictures of my dogs!
