Hi! My name is Samantha Cox, and I am a 2nd year PhD student at the University of Rochester (Rochester, NY), studying chemical engineering under the advisement of Dr. Andrew White in the [WhiteLab](http://thewhitelab.org/). I received my BS in Chemistry from Lee University (Cleveland, TN) in 2021. My undergraduate research was focused on electrochemistry and battery technology, and my graduate research is focused on developing and applying computational tools to solve chemistry and chemical engineering problems. Specifically, my recent work has been focused on molecular dynamics and deep learning. You can read more about my publications in the [publications](https://samcox822.github.io/publications/) tab.

Outside of my research, I am a major trekkie. I love my dogs, sewing/embroidery, hiking, and music. I also play guitar and have recently started dabbling in videography.
