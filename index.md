I'm a PhD candidate in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Rochester, being advised by Dr. Andrew White at the [WhiteLab](http://thewhitelab.org/). My expertise lies in application of computational modeling tools to solve problems in the chemistry and chemical engineering fields. This includes using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study biomolecules, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to make sense of chemical data, and statistical modeling to study potential of energy systems. I also previously worked in the mixed reality space (augmented and virtual reality) for development of tools for chemical education. Read about my work in the [publications](https://hgandhi2411.github.io/publications/) tab!

Outside of my research, I like taking up activities that help me get out of my comfort zone. Few of my many interests include going on outdoor adventures, and reading non-fiction books. Latest addition to that list is sketching, still a novice though. Personal growth is very important to me and I believe growth comes from a consistent work-ethic. As John Maxwell writes, "You will never change your life, until you change something you do daily."
