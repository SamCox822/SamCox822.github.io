I'm a PhD candidate in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Rochester, being advised by Dr. Andrew White at the [WhiteLab](http://thewhitelab.org/). My expertise lies in computational modeling of biomolecules  using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and using statistical modeling and machine learning (ML) to solve problems in the Chemistry and Chemical engineering fields. I also previously worked in the mixed reality space (augmented and virtual reality) for development of tools for chemical education. Read more about my work in the publications tab!

Outside of my research, I like taking up activities that help me get out of my comfort zone. I find exploring uncharted waters intriguing. Few of my many interests include going on outdoor adventures, and reading non-fiction books.  Personal growth is very important to me and I believe growth comes from a compound effect of a consistent work-ethic. As John Maxwell writes, "You will never change your life, until you change something you do daily."
